# Credit-Case-EDA-project
**Loan Default Risk Analysis – EDA Project**

This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand and reduce loan default risk in consumer finance. It reflects a real-world scenario where finance companies assess creditworthiness, especially for applicants with insufficient credit history.

### Objective

Analyze loan application data to identify patterns that predict default risk, helping lenders make better decisions—such as approving loans to reliable applicants and refusing or adjusting terms for high-risk ones.

### Business Challenge

Loan providers face two key risks:
- **False Rejection:** Losing business by rejecting creditworthy applicants.
- **False Approval:** Incurring losses by lending to defaulters.

This project uses EDA to explore these risks and support data-driven lending decisions.

### Data Description

The dataset includes three files:
- **`application_data.csv`:** Information on applicants (income, occupation, loans, etc.).
- **`previous_application.csv`:** Records of previous loan applications, including their status (Approved, Cancelled, Refused, Unused Offer).
- **`columns_description.csv`:** A data dictionary detailing each feature.

Applicants are categorized based on their payment history—those with difficulties (late payments) and those without. 

### Goals

- Identify key variables linked to loan defaults.
- Understand applicant behavior and financial history.
- Help optimize strategies like:
  - Rejecting risky applicants.
  - Adjusting interest rates.
  - Minimizing credit losses.

### Outcome

This case study demonstrates how EDA helps reveal trends, evaluate risk factors, and build smarter lending systems. It also serves as a practical introduction to **risk analytics** in the banking and financial services domain.
